That's right, now you too can drink the "we only hire opensource
contributors" kool-aid.

## Getting Started

1. Install Ruby (if you dont have it already)

        $ sudo apt-get install ruby1.9

(P.S: If you want to be cool you can use RVM. If you want to be super-cool
you can use rbenv)

2. Run the script

        $ ruby greenify.rb


## Contributing

I encourage you to contribute to Green Slate. Feel free to send me pull
requests.
